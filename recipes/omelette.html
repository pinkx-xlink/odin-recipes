    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This one is pretty self-explanatory. Have you got
        eggs and some veggies or meat that you need to use up?
        If so, keep reading so we can clear out some fridge 
        space AND put a hearty meal on the table within 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>This omelette cooks up quickly with as many or as few
        extra bells and whistles as you choose. I like to throw
        mushrooms, spinach, and diced tomatoes on mine, but you 
        might want to add ham, green peppers, onions, or maybe 
        <em>nothing at all</em> to yours.
    </p>
    <p>This can be a meal all on its own, however it also pairs 
        well with has browns, sausages, bacon, toast, or some fresh fruit.
    </p>
