    <h1>Knock Off Taco Bell</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I am one of those disgusting horrible people who 
        would eat Taco Bell 5 nights a week if I could.
        However, I want to live past 27, so here is my 
        personal knock off T-Bell recipe for when I want 
        to satisfy my cravings and keep some of my dignity
        as well.
    </p>
    <p>Before we get into it, I'd like to let you know: 
        THIS IS SUPER EASY AND CHEAP! If I, a 22-year-old 
        who works fulltime on 4 hours of sleep per night
        just to barely be able to pay for my studio apartment, 
        can make this, then you should have no trouble.
    </p>
    <p>The thing that makes this recipe so reliable,
        easy, and versatile is that most of the ingredients 
        can be switched out or completely forgotten
        without compromising the meal. For example,
        I use chicken because I almost always have some on hand,
        but you could use ground beef or steak instead
        if you have a healthier budget than I do.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>tortillas (I usually have flour on hand)</li>
        <li>chicken</li>
        <li>shredded cheese</li>
        <li>beans</li>
        <li>Spanish rice</li>
        <li>tomato paste</li>
        <li>lettuce</li>
        <li>tomatoes</li>
        <li>cumin</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>ground pepper</li>
        <li>garlic powder</li>
        <li>onion powder</li>
        <li>ground oregano</li>
        <li>oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put tomato paste and thawed chicken in your slow cooker;
            cook on high for 1 1/2 - 2 hrs.</li>
        <li>After chicken is cooked, shred it with two forks.
            Add back into slow cooker and mix in seasonings.
        </li>
        <li>Warm tortillas so they don't break when you roll them.</li>
        <li>Add shredded cheese, chicken, rice, beans, and 
            veggies and sauces of your choice to tortillas.</li>
        <li>Roll the burrito closed.</li>
        <li>Add oil to pan over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add burrito to pan WITH THE OPENING SIDE FACE-DOWN - 
            this helps prevent all the goodies in the burrito 
            from spilling out. Let sear for a minute or two (or until golden).
        </li>
        <li>Once the opening side is as gold (or burnt) as you like, flip
            the buritto and sear the other side as well.
        </li>
        
    </ol>
