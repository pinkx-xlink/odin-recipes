    <h1>Poor Man's Ramen, Without the Malnutrition</h1>
    <img

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>As you might have noticed from the previous two recipes, 
        I am a fan of versatile and easy meals. This ramen 
        recipe is no exception!
    </p>
    <p>Perhaps I'm biased since I'm 22 years old and a victim of 
        capitalism (I am poor lol). But <em>perhaps</em> you're also 
        a broke 20-something-year-old who foams at the mouth over 
        cheap chemical-packed meals. If this sounds like you, stay 
        tuned!
    </p>
    <p>Disclaimer: this recipe is the least "recipe" recipe out 
        of all three of the recipes I've included. However, 
        the real purpose of this website is just to showcase 
        some of my HTML and CSS knowledge. If you are in need of 
        some real recipes that somebody put their heart and soul 
        into, I suggest

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>ramen noodles 
            (I like the Neoguri band seafood flavor)</li>
        <li>your choice of veggies/meat</li>
        <h3>Optional:</h3>
        <li>eggs</li>
        <li>chopped green onion</li>
        <li>sliced pork</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 2 cups of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add your noodles and seasoning packet to the water.</li>
        <li>Let cook for 3-5 minutes. If you don't wish to add 
            anything else, you're done! The noodles will be cool 
            enough to eat in a few minutes. :) 
        </li>
        <li>I let my noodles cook for about a minute to soften 
            before I crack 2 eggs directly into the pot. I lower 
            the heat to LOW and put a lid on the top. 
        </li>
        <li>Let the ramen cook on LOW for about 3 more minutes.
            DON'T let it cook too long, or else the egg yolks 
            will become solid.
        </li>
        <li>Poor the ramen into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>I like to add sliced pork and chopped 
            green onions, but you might like to add chicken, 
            beef, peppers, mushrooms, shrimp, etc. Go crazy! :P </li>
        <li>Serve your soup, king UwU </li>
    </ol>
